Extending Python with C
=======================

You can do this in 2 different ways:

* cython
    http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/cythonize.html
    http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/speeding-up-python-numpy-cython-and.html

    - You essentially just write python code, and cython just converts
      the code into C source, which is then compiled into .so file.

    - Declaring static variable types can greatly improve performance.

* directly using Python.h
    http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_further_extensions.htm

    - You learn the internal C API of python, and compile it manually
      using distutils.

* ctypes

    - If it's a simple C function that needs data in and out of python, 
      you can use ctypes to directly translate data as C arrays and call
      the native C func.

* numpy extension
