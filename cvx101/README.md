CVX101 - Convex Optimization
============================

Offered by Stanford. The link to the class website is [here](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/index.html).
It will be good to come back to the material, read the book at your own pace.
Trying out the homework problems using CVX on Matlab will be extremely instructive.

Here are the topics:

* Introduction

* Convex sets

* Convex functions

* Convex optimization problems

* Duality

* Approximation and fitting

* Statistical estimation
