Python Environment Setup
========================
There are lots of useful python libraries available, such as

  * numpy
  * scipy
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn

However, they are PITA to install all on OS X Lion. I found a really useful git project which
includes most of the packages. Install these in the following order:

  1. brew (homebrew cross compile tool)
  ```
  $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
  ```

  2. scipy superpack
